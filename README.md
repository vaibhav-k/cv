## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Engineering Experience

**Machine Learning Intern** @ [SemiCab, Inc.](https://www.semicab.com/) _(May 2022 - Aug 2022)_ <br>
A Collaborative Transportation Platform that uses predictive optimization technology to create Orchestrated Collaboration.
  - Parsed the operations-related emails received by the company and then classified them intent-wise before extracting relevant information from it
  - Used deep learning (transfer with ULMFiT as the base model) and transformer-based zero- and few-shot learning to tackle the problem of less training data
  - Clustered the emails into distinct clusters using DBSCAN for categorized downstream processing
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, Natural language processing, Machine learning, Deep learning, Transfer learning, Clustering, Classification.
<br><br>

**Machine learning engineer (promoted from an SWE Intern)** @ [Drishti Technologies, Inc.](https://drishti.com/) _(Jan 2021 - Aug 2021)_ <br>
Drishti creates streams of data from manual activities on assembly lines, enabling true continuous improvement of human performance‚Äîat scale.
  - Created new DL model KFPs that generate temporal proposals with about 5% higher accuracy
  - Reduced the end-to-end per-frame system latency in the streaming pipeline by about 50%
  - Migrated the essential DL model-related operations from an old API to a new one for easier and more consistent processing
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, REST API, Machine learning, Deep learning, Classification, Kubeflow, Pipeline
    <br><br>

**Master's researcher (advisor: Dr. Benjamin Haibe-Kains)** @ [Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics Lab, The University of Toronto](https://bhklab.ca/) _(Jun 2020 - Dec 2020)_ <br>
BHK Lab researchers actively work in the fields of biomarker discovery and drug repurposing using both preclinical and clinical data.
  - Used Cox regression to find a set of isoforms and isoform switches whose expression levels act as a biomarker for Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  - Reduced the execution time of the R scripts using parallel processing
  - **_Technologies used:_** R, Cox regression, Parallel processing, Isoforms, Biomarkers.
<br><br>

**Research intern (advisor: Dr. Kenta Nakai)** @ [Lab of Functional Analysis in silico (FAiS), The University of Tokyo](https://www.cbms.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/lab/nakai.html) _(May 2018 - Jul 2018)_ <br>
Their study includes the structural analysis of molecular function of each gene product as well as the analysis of its regulatory information, which will lead them to the understanding of its cellular role represented by the networks of inter-gene interactions.
  - Used Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to analyze two datasets (JFCR39 and Depmap Avana CRISPR) that found a set of molecular-activated anticancer drugs and tumor suppressor genes
  - Wrote a package in the PyPi repository that implements NMF ([BigNMF](https://pypi.org/project/bignmf/) with 34,000+ downloads)
  - **_Technologies used:_** Python, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Anticancer drugs, Package, PyPi .
